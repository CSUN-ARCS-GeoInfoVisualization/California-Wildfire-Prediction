### Data

Due to GitHub's size limitations, not all processed data files are included in this repository. Specifically, the processed data files for the year 2020 are not pushed to the `Data` folder.

### Steps to Run the Code

1. **Download Processed Data:** Place the 2020 processed data into the `Data` folder. This data is necessary for running the data cleaning and model training scripts.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Open and run the Jupyter notebook `Data_Cleaning(2021-2022).ipynb` located in the `notebooks` directory. This will clean the data for the years 2021 and 2022. The cleaned data will be saved in the `Output` folder.

3. **Model Training:** Once the data cleaning is complete, open and run the `Model_Training.ipynb` notebook located in the `notebooks` directory. This notebook will use the cleaned data from the `Output` folder to train the model.
