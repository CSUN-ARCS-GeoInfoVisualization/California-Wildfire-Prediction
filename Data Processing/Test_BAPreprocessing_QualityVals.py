'''
Method Description: extract_custom_quality_vals_from_BA_lut(lut)
Purpose: This method processes a DataFrame (referred to as lut for lookup table) to extract custom quality values based on several conditions. It is likely used to filter and refine data for further processing or analysis.
Functionality: The method applies multiple filtering conditions on the DataFrame:
It includes only rows where 'Valid data' is True.
It excludes rows where 'Shortened mapping period' is True.
It excludes rows with certain 'Special circumstances unburned' conditions.
It includes rows where 'Grid cell relabeled algorithm' is True.
Finally, it extracts a list of values from the 'Value' column of the filtered DataFrame.
Usage: This method is used to parse and refine data, ensuring that only entries meeting specific quality criteria are considered in subsequent steps of data processing.
Test Case Descriptions
Test Case: test_extract_valid_custom_quality_vals
Scenario: Testing with a DataFrame that contains some valid data entries according to the method's filtering criteria.
Purpose: To verify that the method correctly extracts the list of quality values when the input DataFrame contains rows that meet all the specified conditions.
Description: This test creates a mock DataFrame with mixed data - some rows meet all the filtering criteria, and others do not. The test checks if the method correctly identifies and extracts the quality values from the rows that meet all conditions.
Test Case: test_extract_no_valid_custom_quality_vals
Scenario: Testing with a DataFrame where no rows meet the filtering criteria.
Purpose: To confirm that the method returns an empty list when none of the rows in the input DataFrame satisfy the filtering conditions.
Description: This test uses a mock DataFrame where all rows fail to meet at least one of the filtering criteria. The test validates that in such a case, the method correctly returns an empty list, indicating no entries passed the quality checks.
Both test cases are essential for ensuring the extract_custom_quality_vals_from_BA_lut(lut) method accurately filters data based on the defined criteria. The first test confirms the method's ability to extract valid data, while the second ensures that the method does not erroneously include invalid data.
