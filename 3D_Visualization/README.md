## Description

This folder contains the source code for processing and visualizing EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and TA (Temperature Anomalies) images. Due to GitHub's size limitations, the actual image files are not included in this repository. To run the code, you will need to place the EVI and TA images in the respective folders. The generated images will be saved in the EVI_output and TA_output folders.
